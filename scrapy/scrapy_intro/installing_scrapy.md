# Installing Scrapy

You can install Scrapy and its dependencies from PyPI:
`pip install scrapy`{{exec}}

To display the Scrapy version, use `scrapy version`. When used with `-v`, it also prints information about Python, Twisted, and the platform. This can be useful for bug reports:
`scrapy version -v`{{exec}}

Since we have successfully installed Scrapy, we can move on to the next step where you will learn more about scrapy shell.
