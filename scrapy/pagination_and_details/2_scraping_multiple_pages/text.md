Web scraping often involves more than just extracting data from a single page. Especially when dealing with paginated content, your spider needs to navigate through multiple pages to gather all the required data. In this section, we'll explore how to modify our Scrapy spider to handle pagination.

Here's the code for a Scrapy spider that scrapes quotes from the website "http://quotes.toscrape.com/" and handles pagination:

```python
import scrapy

class QuotesSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = "quotes_page"
    start_urls = ["http://quotes.toscrape.com/"]
    
    def parse(self, response):
        for quote in response.css('div.quote'):
            quote_dict = {
                'text': quote.css('span.text::text').get(),
                'author': quote.css('small.author::text').get(),
                'tags': quote.css('div.tags a.tag::text').getall()
            }
            yield quote_dict
        
        # Navigate to the next page
        next_page = response.css("li.next a::attr(href)").extract_first()
        if next_page:
            yield response.follow(next_page, callback=self.parse)
```

#### Understanding the Code:

1. **Quote Extraction**: For each quote on the page, we extract the text, author, and tags using CSS selectors and store them in a dictionary named `quote_dict`.

2. **Handling Pagination**: After extracting all quotes from the current page, the spider checks for a link to the next page using the CSS selector `"li.next a::attr(href)"`. If a next page exists, the spider follows the link and continues the scraping process on the subsequent page.

This approach ensures that the spider will navigate through all available pages on the website, extracting quotes until there are no more pages left.

In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into combining pagination with detail scraping, ensuring a comprehensive data extraction process.

### Saving the Spider in Your Project:

Before running the spider, ensure you save it in the appropriate location within your Scrapy project. Typically, spiders are saved in the `spiders` directory of your project.

1. Navigate to your Scrapy project directory.
2. Inside the `spiders` directory, create a new file named `quotes_button.py`.
3. Copy and paste the spider code provided above into this file and save it.

With the spider saved in the correct location, you can now run it using the Scrapy command-line tool.

### Conclusion:

Handling pagination is a crucial aspect of web scraping, especially when dealing with websites that spread their content across multiple pages. By understanding how to navigate through paginated content and ensuring your spider can seamlessly transition from one page to the next, you ensure comprehensive data extraction. The skills you've acquired in this section lay the foundation for more advanced scraping tasks, such as diving into detail pages or handling dynamic content. As you continue your journey with Scrapy, you'll find that these foundational skills serve as building blocks for more complex scraping scenarios.
